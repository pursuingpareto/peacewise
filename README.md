# Peacewise
Building a universe peace by piece.

# Vision
It's the future! There are no serious technical obstacles to humanity achieving true peace and abundance in this decade. We can stop climate change. We can have world peace. We can take care of each other, create together, and explore the stars together.  

The obstacles we do face are those of inertia, fear, and lack of imagination. In order to peacefully transition from the world we have today to the one we want tomorrow, we need to: 

1. show people a vision of the future that is undeniably better for them than the future they currently imagine for themselves. 
2. facilitate and teach a cooperative way of communal coexistence.
3. honor the dignity of all people--you don't get world peace by stealing the soldiers' guns... you get it when they decide to put them down.

# Project 

We are building a single shard (one shared universe) MMO "game" where players will cooperate to form, grow, and improve communities. The communities that players form in-game may mirror real-world communities and power structures.

## Core Values

* Peace
* Love
* Curiosity
* Forgiveness
* Creativity
* Safety, Agency, and Autonomy
* Inclusivity and Belonging
* Dignity
* Justice
* Courageous, Contagious Kindness


## Gameplay Elements

### 0. Respect for all Players
In this game, we want *everyone* to play. That means you, me, Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and anyone else that you may have strong feelings about one way or the other. We want them all here. We want them all to have fun, but we also want to all be equals. This has a couple of corollaries.


1. If the president of the USA *does* join the game, it would be impractical to let all players spam them with messages. 

2. On the other hand, it would be disrespectful too all the other players if the president were truly unreachable.

That leads us to element 1!

### 1. Meaningful Collective Power

To address the dilemma addressed above, we need mechanisms that allow players to meaningfully "pool" their power so they can accomplish things together that they would otherwise be unable to do (like send a message directly to the president).

### 2. Gated Communities
A gated community is one that defines its own rules for membership. This is a crucial building block to several of the other game mechanics.

Inclusivity is a core value for this project and this gameplay element may seem at odds with that. Agency and autonomy are also core values and they need to be respected for inclusivity to have any meaning. A community cannot be coerced into inclusivity: it must be freely offered.

### 3. Authentic "projections of self"
Players must have a **true** identity that contains everything that is relevant and true about them. This might include:
* their name
* their image
* their hopes and dreams
* their age
* their social security number
* their work email address
* etc...

but in the name of safety, we must allow players to situationally mask portions of their "full" identity so that only a limited (but authentic) "projection" of themselves is revealed.

This would allow, for example, a woman in Iowa to say "as a woman in Iowa, I believe..." in a way that protects her identity while still allowing others to trust that this person is, in fact, a woman from Iowa.

### 4. The "Peace Mechanic"
The peace mechanic is built on top of the features listed above and allows for the anonymous creation of in-game pacts with real-world consequences. Examples of pacts:

>  "If 50% of my coworkers agree to  go on strike tomorrow, then I will go on strike tomorrow".

> "If 75% of the soldiers in my platoon agree to put down their weapons and go home tomorrow, I will do the same".

# Structure
This repository--like the universe we are building--strives for self-similarity. And this community--like the communities that will populate our universe--is learning to use [non-violent communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication) to meet our needs.

Where appropriate, at each level of the directory hierarchy you will find the same four files (or *directories* if more structure is needed).

#### `observations`
A place to share concrete observations related to this directory and (potentially) any/all child directories.

#### `feelings`
A place to share feelings and discussion. What about this directory / descendents excites you? What makes you nervous? 

#### `needs`
A place to understand the unmet needs of the contents of this directory.

#### `requests`
A list of concrete proposals / feature-requests for addressing unmet needs.
